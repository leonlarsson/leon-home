                      <p>
                        My work at Electronic Arts (EA) saw me reviewing and
                        ensuring the quality of EA games (PC+consoles) and
                        marketing material such as trailers, websites and much
                        more. During peak seasons, I was also responsible for
                        reviewing the tests of potential candidates, as well as
                        partaking in crafting the application test materials. On
                        The Sims 4, which was my main project, I was the main
                        person responsible for the quality of the Swedish
                        localization effort. This included reviewing all the
                        text, its implementation in-game, and reporting any
                        issues that could not be fixed with a text change.

                        190K members. This included aligning with the EA
                        Community Team to make sure everything went smoothly,
                        which continues to this day.

                        On top of this, I was also involved in the community
                        task force that took care of the Reddit and Discord for
                        Battlefield 1 Incursions. My role there was to help
                        players get access to the game, keep it a safe place,
                        and collect feedback from users. Additionally, I was
                        also a volunteer moderator in the early days of the Apex
                        Legends Discord, helping users and making sure the
                        Discord was a safe place for all.
